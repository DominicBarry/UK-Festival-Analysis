## Overview
An analysis of UK festivals in 2025, demonstrating end-to-end data analysis capabilities. The project combines festival data scraped from the internet with 30 years of historical weather data to provide insights into the UK festival landscape and predict optimal festival experiences based on historical weather patterns.

## Tools Used
- Data Collection: Screaming Frog
- Data Processing: Google Sheets, Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- API Integration: Open-Meteo Weather API
- Development: R Studio
- Visualization: Tableau

## Data Processing Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Scraped festival details using Screaming Frog with custom extracts
   - Processed raw data using regex to extract key data points
   - Geocoded locations using SmartMonkey
   - Augmented dataset with AI-assisted categorization (validated manually)

2. **Weather Data Integration**
   - Developed Python scripts to collect 30 years of historical weather data
   - Created aggregated weather metrics and scoring system
   - Generated comprehensive weather analysis per festival
