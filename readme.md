# UK Festival Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of 206 UK festivals in 2025, combining web scraped festival data with 30 years of historical weather patterns to provide insights and predict optimal festival experiences through interactive visualizations.

## Overview

- Festival info scraped from the internet, extracted, cleaned, augmented, geocoded
- Geocoded weather data sourced from Open-Meteo.com
- Screaming Frog, Google Sheets, Geocoding by SmartMonkey, Claude.ai, R, Python & Tableau used
- It was then imported into Tableau & augmented with calculated fields to support further analysis

## Caveats & Assumptions

Festival specifc information was scraped from 3rd party sites on the internet & is not guaranteed to be reliable but does provide a reasonable data set for analysis. It would be very interesting to repeat this analysis using first party data from industry bodies and/or licensing authorities.
